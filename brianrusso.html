  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>I am an <strong> author, illustrator</strong>, and <strong>web coder</strong>. I believe creating simple and elegant websites and apps is the best way to share my ideas.</p>
  <p>I believe in finishing things that I start, excelling through trial and error, and having fun with things I work on. </p>
  <p>I also believe that going through an entire jar of <strong>peanut butter</strong> in one sitting is sometimes okay.

  <h1>Where are you from?</h1>
  <p>I was born in Glen Ellyn, Illinios. When I was six I moved to Short Hills, New Jersey, where I grew up. After high school, I moved to <strong>New York City</strong>, and have lived here ever since. </p>

  <h1>More About Me</h1>
  <h2>What are your hobbies?</h2>
  <p>I  enjoy moving around a lot and making people laugh. Over the past couple years that has translated in <strong>yoga, dancing,</strong> and <strong>improv/stand-up comedy.</strong></p>
  <h2>What would be your dream job?</h2>
  <p>I’d love to work with a small creative team, constantly coming up with <strong>funny stories, characters,</strong> and <strong>scenarios</strong>. Using my illustration, writing, and web-coding skills in tandem would be a really exciting challenge. I’d also like to work in an environment that is <strong>project-based</strong> and <strong>deadline driven.</strong> So, some examples would be: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Writing for a tv or web <strong>Comedy Series</strong></li>
      <li>Storyboarding for a show like <strong>Adventure Time</strong></li>
      <li>Writing and Illustrating <strong>Children's Books</strong></li>
      <li>creating <strong>funny, interative</strong> content for children online</li>
    </ul>
  <h2>What music have you been listening to?</h2>
  <p>I like sampling music from across genres and time periods: <strong>Vampire Weekend, Wu-Tang Clan,</strong> and <strong>The Doors</strong>, to name a few. </p>
  <h2>Anything Else?</h2>
  <p>I’m a big <strong>Harry Potter</strong> Nerd, and a proud member of the house of <strong>Hufflepuff</strong> on <a href="http://pottermore.com"> Pottermore.com</a>.  Hufflepuffs value <strong>hard work, fair play</strong>, and <strong>practicality</strong>. </p>
  <p>I am very interested in the idea of <strong>consciousness</strong> and where it comes from. This comes back to my love of <strong>writing</strong>. I believe that our reality is very much shaped by the <strong>stories we tell</strong> and <strong>metaphors we use</strong>.</p>
  <p>Also, I've created a site featuring bunnies doing yoga which you can see at <a href="http://bunnyoga.com">Bunnyoga.com</a>
